            <h1>About MMSF</h1>
            <p>TWe bring to life their dream by supporting the children from rural communities who are less privileged through education empowerment and provision of right information to prevent early marriages especially among girls.


Mirriam Mambwe Rural Scholarship Foundation is based in chanyanya village which is about 35km away from kafue town. It has been in existence for a year and has over 100 children on the program which includes provision of quality education and rural outreach programs.
Its mission is to create a platform that pays particular attention to the inclusion of education to rural children providing them with the same opportunities as those in the city without living anyone behind.
In 2025, we will include over 500 vulnerable rural children on the program and empower them with right information as well as equip them with the materials needed for their education to run smooth. 
We will intensify the outreach program to ensure that the childrenâ€™s wellbeing is prioritized and also school motivation which is currently running every 3 months to promote increase in awareness of a better life beyond what the eyes can see within their reach.
